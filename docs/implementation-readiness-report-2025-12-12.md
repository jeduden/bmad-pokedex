# Implementation Readiness Report

**Project:** bmad-pokedex
**Date:** 2025-12-12
**Assessor:** BMAD Gate Check

## Executive Summary

**Readiness Status: READY WITH CONDITIONS**

The PRD and Architecture documents are well-aligned and comprehensive. However, **epic/story breakdown is missing** - this must be created before implementation can begin.

---

## Document Inventory

| Document | Status | Quality |
|----------|--------|---------|
| PRD.md | ✅ Complete | Excellent - 6 FRs, clear NFRs, success criteria |
| architecture.md | ✅ Complete | Excellent - tech stack, patterns, structure |
| epics/stories | ❌ Missing | **Required before implementation** |
| UX spec | ⚪ Not required | PRD contains sufficient UX guidance |

---

## Alignment Validation

### PRD ↔ Architecture Alignment: PASSED ✅

| PRD Requirement | Architecture Support |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| FR1: Random Pokemon | `useRandomPokemon` hook, Home page |
| FR2: Pokemon Search | `SearchBar` component, debounced query |
| FR3: Pokemon Detail | `PokemonDetail`, `PokemonStats`, evolution chain |
| FR4: Type Filtering | `TypeBadge`, filter components |
| FR5: Gen Filtering | Filter by generation supported |
| FR6: Pokemon Browse | `Browse` page, `PokemonCard` grid |

### NFR Coverage: PASSED ✅

| NFR | Architecture Approach |
|-----|----------------------|
| Performance | TanStack Query caching, lazy loading, <200KB bundle |
| Integration | PokeAPI client in `src/lib/api.ts` |
| Accessibility | WCAG AA, ARIA labels, keyboard nav |

### Technical Consistency: PASSED ✅

- Consistent tech stack across all documents
- Implementation patterns well-defined
- Naming conventions established
- Error handling patterns specified

---

## Gap Analysis

### Critical Gaps

| Gap | Impact | Resolution |
|-----|--------|------------|
| **No epics/stories document** | Cannot begin implementation | Run `create-epics-and-stories` workflow |

### Minor Issues

| Issue | Impact | Resolution |
|-------|--------|------------|
| PRD mentions SSR for SEO | Low - SPA chosen | Consider prerendering for Pokemon pages post-MVP |

---

## Positive Findings

- **Excellent PRD-Architecture alignment** - Every requirement maps to architecture
- **Clear implementation patterns** - Naming, structure, error handling defined
- **Well-scoped MVP** - 6 focused functional requirements
- **Pragmatic tech choices** - Vite + React + TanStack Query ideal for this SPA
- **Complete project structure** - Ready for implementation

---

## Readiness Checklist

### Core Documents
- [x] PRD exists and is complete
- [x] PRD contains measurable success criteria
- [x] PRD defines clear scope boundaries
- [x] Architecture document exists
- [ ] **Epic/story breakdown exists** ← BLOCKING

### Alignment
- [x] Every FR has architectural support
- [x] NFRs addressed in architecture
- [x] Tech decisions include rationale
- [x] Implementation patterns defined

### Ready to Proceed
- [ ] **All critical issues resolved** ← Need epics/stories
- [x] Tech stack supports requirements
- [x] Project structure defined
- [x] Development environment documented

---

## Recommendations

### Before Implementation (Required)

1. **Create Epics and Stories**
   - Run: `/bmad:bmm:workflows:create-epics-and-stories`
   - Break down 5 suggested epics into implementable stories
   - Define acceptance criteria for each story

### During Implementation (Suggested)

2. **First Story: Project Initialization**
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest bmad-pokedex -- --template react-ts
   ```
   - Follow architecture.md setup commands

3. **Epic Sequencing**
   - Epic 1 (Infrastructure) → Epic 2 (Discovery) → Epic 3 (Visual) → Epic 4 (Browse) → Epic 5 (Polish)

---

## Conclusion

**Status: READY WITH CONDITIONS**

PRD and Architecture are solid and well-aligned. Create the epics/stories document, then implementation can begin immediately.

**Next Step:** `/bmad:bmm:workflows:create-epics-and-stories`
