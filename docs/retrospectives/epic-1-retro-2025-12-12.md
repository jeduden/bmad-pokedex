# Epic 1 Retrospective: Foundation & Setup

**Date:** 2025-12-12
**Facilitator:** Bob (Scrum Master)
**Epic:** Epic 1 - Foundation & Setup

---

## Epic Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Stories Completed | 4/4 (100%) |
| Blockers Encountered | 0 |
| Technical Debt Items | 3 (advisory) |
| Production Incidents | 0 |

**Stories Delivered:**
- 1.1: Project Initialization (Vite + React + TypeScript)
- 1.2: Tailwind & shadcn/ui Setup
- 1.3: Routing Setup (React Router v7)
- 1.4: PokeAPI Client Setup (TanStack Query)

---

## What Went Well

1. **Incremental Build Approach** - Each story built cleanly on the previous, with clear dependencies
2. **Architecture Documentation** - Clear patterns (I prefix, use prefix, path aliases) enabled consistent implementation
3. **Thorough Code Reviews** - Every story had AC verification with specific file references
4. **Knowledge Transfer** - Dev notes documented issues like Tailwind v4→v3.4 compatibility

---

## Challenges and Growth Areas

1. **Version Drift** - Architecture doc specified Vite 5.x/React Router v6, but current versions (6.x/v7) were used
2. **Dependency Compatibility** - Tailwind v4 to v3.4 downgrade for shadcn/ui not obvious upfront
3. **Test Infrastructure Missing** - No Vitest setup; no unit tests for hooks or API client

---

## Key Insights

1. Keep architecture docs updated with actual versions used
2. Document dependency compatibility issues immediately when discovered
3. Test infrastructure should be prioritized earlier in future projects

---

## Action Items

| Action | Owner | Priority | Deadline |
|--------|-------|----------|----------|
| Update architecture.md with Vite 6.x, React Router v7 | Tech Writer | Low | Before Epic 3 |
| Add Vitest test infrastructure | Dev Team | Medium | Epic 2 or 5 |

---

## Epic 2 Preparation

**Status:** READY TO START

**Dependencies on Epic 1:** All complete
- Routing setup ✅
- API client and hooks ✅
- shadcn/ui components ✅

**Blockers:** None

**Preparation Tasks:** None required

---

## Significant Discoveries

No significant discoveries that require updating Epic 2's plan. The foundation is solid and ready for feature development.

---

## Next Steps

1. Run `epic-tech-context` workflow for Epic 2
2. Begin Story 2.1: Random Pokemon Display
3. Address test infrastructure during Epic 2 or defer to Epic 5
